ABSTRACT

The aim of this project is to create a chatbot using IBM Watson service for understanding natural language and response. 
The chatbot will be trained on a large dataset of conversational data and will be able to carry out a variety of tasks such as answering questions, 
providing information, and completing actions. Additionally, the chatbot will be integrated with a knowledge base to provide more accurate and informative responses to users. 
The chatbot utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries in a human-like manner.
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can effectively communicate with users and provide them with the information. 
The concept of the conversation is central to a chatbot. A chatbot can converse with a human but its capabilities are limited. 
That is not to say however that in very narrow ways the text based conversation can be good as or better than conversing with an actual human. 
The chatbot can be customized and trained to respond to a wide range of questions and requests from users, providing information, assistance, and 
support across various domains.  Chatbot can have advantages over human agents.
They are available 24/7 and they have access to a very broad array of information and functionality.
They can also outperform humans in terms of speed and accuracy in a narrow domain.
The problem however is making sure the end users are aware of these limitations. 
This chatbot will be useful for businesses, customer service and also for personal assistance. 
The chatbot will be accessible through multiple channels such as a website, mobile app like Whatsapp and Telegram
